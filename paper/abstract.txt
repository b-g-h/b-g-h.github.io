Using LaTeX in Schools: Simplifying Inclusive STEM Education

We report on experience of the use of LaTeX in Schools to teach mathematics to
blind and visually impaired children. For the last 20 years the German education
has phased out the use of sophisticated mathematical Braille notations and
replace it by teaching children from year one LaTeX (or LaTeX-like) notation in
mathematics. This notation made tactile by translating it into 8-dot Euro
Braille thus removing the use of indicators and the need express single
characters with multiple Braille cells. The aim was to reduce the learning curve
for students as well as to improve their abilities to autor and communicate
mathematics with peers and teachers that are not trained in Braille, which is
paramount for inclusive education.

We present how this approach can technically supported via web technology that
can not only render LaTeX, but also provide 8 dot Braille output for expressions
as well as compute meaningful LaTeX commands for sub-expression and support for
direct copying from web sites.

Finally, we will discuss our initial steps to transfer this model to other
education systems, namely the Dutch system, where the current approach is
ambivalent, in that there exists an AsciiMath-like linearized math notation for
teaching to BVI students, while tactile math textbooks use an outdated Braille
notation, that is effectively no longer used in teaching.  As a result students
are actively discouraged from studying mathematics.
